# transport-company-managment

A group project made to manage the transportation for a company. Both customers and employee can access it, admins are included too. 
What I, Martina have worked on:
- creating the logic behind this project
- creating a major part of the back-end, entities, methods, requests, etc.
- extra work on the front-end as a helping hand for my colleagues. 

note: this project is from winter 2023/2024 and no Spring Security is applied to it. This is a skill, learned later on and showed in my 'school-managment-system' project, public on my github.
